# RFI-GAN
Detection of Radio Frequency Interference Using an Improved Generative Adversarial Network  
## Introduction
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a type of inevitable noise in the radio astronomy data collection process. It can corrupt weak cosmic signals and potentially lead to misleading analysis. The proper identification of RFI during data processing thus is critical to obtain clean and high-quality data. This need will become even more urgent when next generation of large radio telescopes, such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) comes into service and generates an increasing amount and complexity of radio signal data. Among RFI identification methods, detection using artificial intelligence (AI) has particularly demonstrated advantages in superior efficiency, accuracy and less human intervention. We thus propose a RFI detection model based on Pix2Pix, an image-to-image translation solver using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): RFI-GAN. This model transforms the RFI detection to an image translation problem and trains two deep neural networks that contest each other to output a binary RFI mask picture by
eliminating RFI noises. We also optimize the network structures of the generator and discriminator used in the Pix2Pix model for better quality of RFI detection, making it suitable for processing data from single antenna radio telescope. The model is designed to serve the upcoming FAST data and has been evaluated using a standard simulation data set
generated by the HI Data Emulator (HIDE). Experimental results have shown that our model can achieve higher scores (99% ) on accuracy, recall and F1-score than other RFI detection methods.
## Main work
1.Transform the RFI detection problem into an image-to-image translation problem using GAN, that is, seeking the RFI distribution is converted to an “image” translation problem. This brings us a new approach for RFI identification.    
2.Apply the adversarial learning strategy to learning of the RFIs distribution automatically to reduce the need for human intervention.
